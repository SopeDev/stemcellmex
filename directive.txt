Design a modern, visually captivating website for a cutting-edge medical stem cell company, incorporating the official color palette and typography to convey technological innovation and professional excellence. Use a clinical yet inviting color scheme built around the main colors:

Aphrodite Aqua (#45EDB9) as a vibrant accent for key highlights, calls to action, and decorative elements evoking advanced biomedical technology.

Stellar Explorer (#002B2B) as the primary dark base, giving the website a bold, high-contrast, and futuristic feel.

Journey To The Sky (#CCEDEC) as a soft background or section divider for fresh, clean expanses.

Auxiliary colors Light Mint (#BFFFBD), Luminescent Sky (#CAFFFB), and Lamiaceae (#40FFDF) can be used sparingly for gradients, subtle overlays, hover states, or micro-interactions, reinforcing a modern, science-forward aesthetic.

Imagery & Shapes:

Emphasize abstract, organic forms inspired by cells, molecules, and microscopic structures.

Use translucent layers, fluid shapes, and soft gradients to suggest depth, precision, and motion.

Incorporate textures or visuals referencing laboratory imagery (e.g., bubble patterns, microfluidics) to enhance the sense of advanced research.

Typography:

Specter (Bold → Light → Regular) – primary headings; use bold for main titles, light or regular for supporting text within the same section.

Calvino Grande (Regular → Light → Light Italic) – secondary headings or impactful phrases; use regular weight for body of the phrase, switching to light italic for keywords or emphasis (e.g., “Your Health is their Future”, with Health and Future in light italic).

Bio Sans (Regular → Light → Light Italic) – auxiliary content, subtext, body paragraphs; maintain clarity and modern professionalism, applying light italic sparingly for subtle emphasis.

Overall Mood:

Conveys cutting-edge science, modern medicine, and trustworthiness.

Balances sleek minimalism with organic visuals to keep the experience both professional and approachable.

Should feel premium, inviting, and aligned with the latest medical technologies — exactly matching the client’s vision of “una página moderna y cautivadora para el ojo”.

In the "reference" folder of this project you will find 4 documents:

faq is literally for the faq section.
general info is a document with info about the company.
website info is a document the client sent me with content (copy) specifically for the website.
propuesta is part of the proposal sent to the client, it contains specs for the website structure and content.

the base tech stack for the project will be html, css, javascrtipt; no frameworks.
