Stemcell MX — Integrated Visual Style & Mood Guide
Overall Mood

The website should project a modern, sophisticated, and science-driven identity while carrying a human and wellness-oriented warmth.
It should balance clinical trust (clean, minimal, professional) with organic vitality (fluid, natural forms and textures), evoking both cutting-edge biomedical innovation and approachability.

The overall feeling is premium but approachable — positioned between a high-end wellness brand and a serious medical institution.
It must match the client’s vision of “una página moderna y cautivadora para el ojo”.

Color Palette & Atmosphere

Primary Colors:

Aphrodite Aqua (#45EDB9) – Vibrant accent for key highlights, calls to action, and decorative elements. Suggests advanced biomedical technology, freshness, and innovation.

Stellar Explorer (#002B2B) – Bold, deep teal base for contrast and a futuristic, elegant feel.

Journey To The Sky (#CCEDEC) – Soft background tone for fresh, clean sections.

Auxiliary Colors:

Light Mint (#BFFFBD)

Luminescent Sky (#CAFFFB)

Lamiaceae (#40FFDF)
These should be used sparingly for gradients, hover states, overlays, or micro-interactions, adding depth and reinforcing a luminous, watery aesthetic.

Atmosphere:

Dominated by deep teal backdrops for elegance.

Bright aqua/mint tones energize the palette.

Occasional very light mint or sky blue backgrounds break up darker sections.

The palette should feel fresh, watery, and luminous.

Typography

Primary (Headings):

Specter (Bold → Light → Regular) – Bold for main titles; light or regular for supporting text within the same section.

Secondary (Impactful Phrases):

Calvino Grande (Regular → Light → Light Italic) – Use regular for the main phrase, switching to light italic for emphasis on keywords (e.g., “Your Health is their Future” → Health and Future in light italic).

Auxiliary (Body & Subtext):

Bio Sans (Regular → Light → Light Italic) – For paragraphs and subtext. Apply light italic sparingly for subtle emphasis.

Feel & Use:

Serif headlines with selective italics create an editorial, intelligent tone.

Sans-serif body copy ensures clarity and modernity.

Strong, confident headings contrast with light, airy supporting text.

Text should feel integrated into the layout — overlapping textures, within shapes, or on clean color fields.

Graphic Language

Organic “cell/amoeba” shapes as cutouts, masks, or frames for imagery.

Secondary motif: small flower/rosette cell icon for decoration or bullets.

Shapes should be fluid and biomorphic, hinting at stem cells without being literal.

Incorporate translucent layers, fluid shapes, and soft gradients for depth and motion.

Subtle references to laboratory imagery (e.g., bubble patterns, microfluidics).

Photography Style

Mix of black & white portraits (emotional connection) and clinical lifestyle shots (credibility — hands, lab tools, injections).

Sports and active lifestyle imagery within organic shapes to convey vitality and recovery.

Macro shots of bubbles, water ripples, and ink dispersions for abstract backgrounds.

Images may be tinted with mint/aqua for brand cohesion.

Texture & Backgrounds

Softly blurred, abstract scientific or watery textures.

Bubbles and liquid swirls suggesting regenerative processes.

Backgrounds often layered behind color panels or inside organic masks for a clean layout.

Tone & Brand Personality

Trustworthy – Grounded in science, safety, and expertise.

Innovative – Design and visuals feel “next-gen.”

Human-centered – Imagery and copy convey care, empathy, and wellness.

Minimal but expressive – Each visual element has a clear purpose.

Technical & Implementation Notes

Base stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no frameworks).

Maintain performance and clean code — minimal bloat.

Use subtle animations/micro-interactions (hover effects, smooth transitions) to enhance engagement.

Structure should align with the content specs in the propuesta document, with reference to “faq”, “general info”, and “website info” docs for copy and section layout.
